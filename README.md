# The lord of the ngs - the fellowship of the ng

## Lore

The fellowship of the ng is a pseudo game based in lore of the lord of the rings.

In this first part of the game the fellowship formed by our well-known 9 characters will try to destroy the one ng. 

The fellowship is composed by:

- Gandalf the white
- Aragorn
- Legolas
- Gimli
- Boromir
- Pippin
- Merry
- Sam
- Frodo

Each character has a set of skills and abilities that will be used to defeat the one ng.

The ng is a powerful entity that has a set of skills and abilities and will be used to defeat the fellowship through the manipulation of different creatures of the middle earth.
